ECEN 758 convolutional neural network

We developed a method to classify different articles of clothing based on imaging can have a profound impact on the retail industry. Through the mastery of predicting what category different pieces of clothing fall into, 
organizations can take business model approaches to maximizing revenue for different types of clothing during different times of the year. Furthermore, optimization of how much inventory to have on hand and when to keep up 
with the inconsistent rise and fall of supply and demand are pivotal decisions that need to be made correctly. In this report, a large-scale dataset consisting of greater than 60,000 28 x 28 grayscale images is utilized. 
The images are linked to one of ten classes, which are T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle Boot. Overall, this Fashion-MNIST dataset from [1] will be used in the development and comparison 
of multiple machine learning models in Python, including but not limited to density-based supervised learning, ensemble learning, and neural networks. Through multiple experiments, it was determined that the 
convolutional neural network was the most successful due to higher accuracy.
